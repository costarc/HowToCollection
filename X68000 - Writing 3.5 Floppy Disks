Here I describe all the steps required to write 3.5 inch floppy disks using a modern PC, first using Windows 11, then using Linux.

What you need:
- Floppy Disk Drive: Sony Model PCGA-UFD5 (USB). Other USB floppys that that has 3mode will also work.
- DiskImage13b (get it here: https://github.com/costarc/HowToCollection/blob/master/Support%20Files/DiskImage13b.exe)
- 3.5" 2HD floppy disk, 1.44MB
- The disk image in XDF format - in my tests, DIM and D88 images did not work.
- Formatting the disk prior to writing a new image is not always required - format it if the process fails.

X68000 - Writing 3.5 inch floppy disks in Windows
=================================================

This guide was developed and tested in Windows 11 - therefore it is verified that it supports USB Floppy Disk Drives and can write 3.5 floppy disks for X68000.

1. Optionally, format the disk. For example, to format a disk from command line: format a: /FS:FAT /V:X68000
2. Run DiskImage13b and choose these options:
3. Windows: Xp/2K
4. FD drive: A:
5. FD Mode: 1.25M
6. HD -> FD (125)
7. Select the disk image
8. When the popup "INSERT Blank_Disk in DRV !!" appear, click OK

When DiskImage finishes writing the disk, the disk is ready to use.


X68000 - Writing 3.5 inch floppy disks using Linux
===================================================

Writing floppies using Linux is a breeze, even when using a VM (such as a Linux VM running under VirtualBox).

This process is the same as in NFGGames: https://gamesx.com/wiki/doku.php?id=x68000:writing_3.5_floppies

But here, I jump over all the options (which I tried and failed) and go straight to what worked for me, very easily.

1. Boot your linux PC, or install in a VM. I recommend Lubuntu, due to smaller footprint compared to other Ubuntu distributions.
2. Install packages required:
  sudo apt install ufiformat
3. Connect the USB floppy drive to the PC. It should be automatically recognized by the Linux VM (probably as device /dev/sdb)
4. Umount the floppy (because by default, it is mounted when plugged into the PC):
  sudo umount /dev/sdb
5. Format the floppy disk
  sudo ufiformat -f 1232 /dev/sdb
6. Transfer your XDF images to a local folder in the linux system (use scp, wget, or other means)
7. Write the XDF image to the floppy disk:
  sudo dd if=flop.xdf of=/dev/sdb

The floppy is ready to use.
