Using default Pin Assigments will get you in troube when trying to use the SD Card.

Happens that one of the pins assigned to SD_DAT is shared with another functoin in the DE1, which will cause the error:


go to assignments, device, device&pin settings , dual purpose pins... change the nCEO to be a regular I/O pin.. 

  Error (176310): Can't place multiple pins assigned to pin location Pin_W20 (IOC_X50_Y2_N1)
	Info (176311): Pin SD_DAT is assigned to pin location Pin_W20 (IOC_X50_Y2_N1)

To work around this, cahnge a settings using the Quartus IDE:

Assignments -> Device -> Device and Pin Options... -> Dual Purpose Pins

Change nCEO from "Use as programming pin" to "Use as regular I/O"

Compile the project and it should now be sucesfull.
