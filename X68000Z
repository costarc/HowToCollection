Notes:
------
 1. To download the required packages for the updates described in this guide, you must first register the X68000Z in https://dev.zuiki.com/project-z/community  
  (My page -> Product Registration)
 2. The SCSI configuratioin procedure requires you to navigate the SXWindow graphical user interface. I did it using the X68000Z mouse, and have not even tested if it will work with any USB mouse. I guess if you do not have the X68000Z mouse you have nothign to loose testing with amny USB mouse, right ?

2. Using a HDD Disk Image
-------------------------

What you need:
 - The System SDCARD (SX-Window) SDCARD that came with the X68000 (The RED one)
 - 1 x SDHC SDCARD format as FAT32
 - The gamepad controller conected to the X68000Z (to navigate the menus)
 - The X68000z mouse (to navigate the SXWindow)
 - 1 x PENDRIVE formatted as FAT32
 - The Pseudo-SCSI file packages (downloaded from Zuiki web site)
 - A HDD disk image (you an use your own, or download  from Zuiki web site)

Steps:
- Jump to  https://dev.zuiki.com/project-z/community/resource
- Download The HDD images you want to use with the X68000Z (this image contains both HDD image and pscsi.ini files)
- Unzip the HDD image and copy to /Z68000Z/ folder in your FAT32-formatted PENDRIVE
- copy "pscsi.ini" to /Z68000Z/ folder in your FAT32-formatted PENDRIVE
- Unzip the "Body Update Update Data Ver.1.4.0" (downloaded in "1. Firmaware Update to 1.4" above)
- copy "bootconf.xdf" FROM "Body Update Update Data Ver.1.4.0" to /X68000Z/ folder in your SDHC SDCARD

Now the configuration process:
- Inset the System SDCARD (RED SDCARD with SXWindow) into slot 0
- Insert your SDHD SDCARD with bootconf.xdf into slot 1
- Plug the PENDRIVE into one fo the back USB connectors
- Boot the X68000Z and start the Emulator
- In the OSC screen to select floppy images, select the disk "bootconf.xdf" for slot 1
- Continue the boot into the emulator and it should boot ito SXWindow
- Two windows will popup, one for Drive A: and another behind for Drive B:
- Using the mouse, click the window for Drive B:
- Run (double click) BOOTSCS0.X - a black screen should popup, and a message "vs.x: press mouse button or key."
- Restart the X68000Z and boot into the emulator - it should now boot from the HDD disk image.


3. Using multiple HDD disk images
---------------------------------

You can use your own HDD disk image by changin pscsi.ini file.

[pscsi]
ID0=SCSIHDD81M.HDS

ID0=<nme of your disk image in the PENDRIVE>

You can settup more than one HDD disk image as below:
[pscsi]
ID0=scsi_hdd0.hds
ID1=scsi_hdd1.hds

Note: The X68000 has a main SCSI ID, which is set (and can be viewed) using switch.x from humanos command line.
Do not set any of your HDD SCSI IDs to the SCSI ID that is configured in switch.x
