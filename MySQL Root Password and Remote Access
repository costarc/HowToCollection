It's possible to logon into mysql-server without providing a password, as long as it's done from root user:
sudo mysql -u root -p
<enter>

The password can then be set to to allow login using mysql native authentication:

UPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = 'mysql_native_password', authentication_string = PASSWORD('changeme') WHERE User = 'root';
