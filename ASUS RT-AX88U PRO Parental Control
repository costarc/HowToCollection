ASUS RT-AX88U PRO Parental Control

This guide uses the custom firmware Asuswrt-merlin.

Not an bullet proof guide, this is just the steps I applie so far to achieve some safe level of search, content access and online time control.

This might be updated as I find out better ways, new ways or missing configuration to improve how safe my family browse and access the internet resources.

Step 1 - Control Online Time
Parental Controls -> Web & Apps Filters
 - Enable (ON)
 - Add a filter for each ethernet mac address to enforce these filter. Tick the boxes for:
  - Adult
  - Instant Message and Communication
  - P2P and File Transfer

Apply
Parental Controls ->Time Scheduling
 - Enable blok all devices: OFF
 - Enable Time Scheduling: ON
 - For each "Client Name" (drop down box) to enforce limits, click "+"
  - Define the time window for weekdays (start & end time)
  - Define the time window for weekends (start & end time)
Make sure the sliders in front of each of these schedules are on the right side (ON)
Apply

Step 2 - Block specific URLs
This is already blocked by some of the Parental Controls confgured in the step 3, but this was my first line of defence, so I keep it here for reference and also "just in case" the other filters fail.
Firewall -> URL Filter
- Enable URL Filter: ON
- Filter table type: Deny List
- URL Filter List:  Enter a keyword and press "+", until the required list is show in the list below the option. Some filters added:
 tiktok
 tiktok	
 snapchat	
 onlyfans	
 nsfw	
 reddit	
 4chan	
 2chan	
 8chan
 omegle	
 liveleak	
 gore	
 ogrish	
 paltalk
  
Apply

Step 3 - Enforce filter using custom DNS
User Defined DNS 1 is a OpenDSN with Family + Adult filters. DNS 2 & 3 are there to manually switch in case of failure in the DNS 1.
- Lan -> DNS Director
 Settings:
  - Enable DNS Director: ON
  - Global Redirection: User Defined 1
  - User defined DNS 1: 1.1.1.3
  - User defined DNS 1: 208.67.222.123
  - User defined DNS 1: 8.8.8.8
 Client List (Max Limit: 64)
  In this section, included clients to bypass the DNS filters - select "No Redirection" and click "+"

 Apply

Administration -> System
 - Enable JFFS custom scripts and configs: ON
Apply

ssh admin@www.asusrouter.com:22 
echo "cname=www.google.com,forcesafesearch.google.com" > /jffs/configs/dnsmask.conf.add
echo "216.239.38.120 forcesafesearch.google.com" > /jffs/configs/hosts.add
service restart_dnsmasq
