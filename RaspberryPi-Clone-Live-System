Clone a live Linux & Raspberry Pi filesystem to a disk image, in a proper format that can be used to write back to another SD Card.

This instructions uses image-utils scripts (downloaded from somewhere and cannot find the address - will update if I do)

1. Plug a big SD card to the device - must be FAT32 formatted and big enough to store the Linux/Raspberry Pi (device)  disk image

2. Identify the SD Card device number: 
sudo fdisk -l
Device     Boot Start       End   Sectors   Size Id Type
/dev/sda1       32768 249737215 249704448 119.1G  b W95 FAT32

3. Mount the SD Card:
sudo mkdir /media/fat32
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/fat32

4. Run image-backup to create the disk image:
sudo ./image-backup
Image file to create? /media/fat32/raspbian_lite.img
Initial image file ROOT filesystem size (MB) [3155]? 
Added space for incremental updates after shrinking (MB) [0]? 100
Create /media/fat32/raspbian_lite.img (y/n)?

5. unmount the SD Card:
sudo unmount /media/fat32

6. Use Raspberry Pi Imager to write this image to a new SD Card
