GHDL

GHDL is the tool to use, either in Windows, Mac or Linux: 

1. download and install GHDL and GTKWave
These tools should be uncomoressed and copied to a location of your choice.

GHDL: https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/releases
GTKWave: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/


2. Adde the bin directory fir each of thesse tools to the Windows environment
<GHDL Install Dir>/bin
<GTKWave Install dir>/bin

3. Create a test bech for you design, for example:
Design file name: test.vhd
Entity name: test
Test bench file name: test_tb.vhd
Test bench entity name: test_tb

4. Create a bat file to simulate and generate the wave forms. for the example files in step 3 above, the bat file is:
ghdl -a test.vhd
ghdl -a test_tb.vhd
ghdl -e test_tb
ghdl -r test_tb --stop-time=200ps --vcd=test_tb.vcd
gtkwave test_tb.vcd

5. Load your simulation into GTKWave with favorite signals
Setup the signals in GTKWave then save (for example, test_tb.gtkw) for quick load:
ghdl -a test.vhd
ghdl -a test_tb.vhd
ghdl -e test_tb
ghdl -r test_tb --stop-time=200ps --vcd=test_tb.vcd
gtkwave -a test_tb.gtkw test_tb.vcd
